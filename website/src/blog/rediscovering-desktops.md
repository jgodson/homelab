There was a time â€” back when I was a teenager â€” when I could name the latest graphics cards by heart, tell you the clock speeds of new CPUs, and recite motherboard socket compatibility like it was second nature. Iâ€™d built and upgraded a few PCs by then, and loved digging into hardware reviews or lurking on forums full of other enthusiasts. As the years passed and life got busier, I gradually drifted away â€” partly because I wasnâ€™t gaming or tinkering as much anymore, but also because my developer journey began, and I found myself increasingly drawn toward the Mac ecosystem. Laptops became the simpler, more portable choice, and for a while, that was good enough.

That is, until recently.

## A Return to the Tower

Fast forward to today. Iâ€™ve been reminded in a big way why desktop computers still make more sense â€” not just for gamers and power users, but for anyone who values flexibility and long-term usability.

It started when I picked up a used gaming PC for my son. The specs were humble by modern standards: a 4th gen Intel i7, an era-matching motherboard, a GeForce GTX 1660 GPU, and a datacenter-grade Intel SSD. But with a fresh case that looked the part and an old 4K monitor I had lying around, the thing looked slick and ran surprisingly well.

Roblox? No problem.  
Fortnite on medium settings? Smooth.  
Editing videos for YouTube? No sweat.

(Side note: What kid _isnâ€™t_ an aspiring YouTuber these days?)

## The Catch: No Wireless

There was just one snag. The machine had no built-in WiFi or Bluetooth â€” and it lives on the upper floor of the house, well away from the router. I wasnâ€™t keen on running an Ethernet cable between floors, and he relies on a Bluetooth headset and Xbox controller for gaming.

I thought I had a quick fix:  
- A free USB WiFi adapter that was included with the PC 
- An old USB Bluetooth adapter I dug out from my parts bin

Technically, it _worked_. But barely.

The WiFi adapter seemed to max out at the time at less than **2MB/s**, meaning Fortnite needed an overnight download (much to my sonâ€™s frustration). I tested before the upgrade again and it seemed to have improved a bit since then.

The Bluetooth adapter was decent for the controller, but the audio connection constantly cut out. Choppy audio during a Fortnite match? Not a great experience.

With a laptop, Iâ€™d be stuck looking for two better USB dongles â€” assuming I even had two free ports. But this is where desktops shine.

## The PCIe Advantage

Desktop PCs have expansion slots â€” glorious, underappreciated expansion slots.

Ours had a free PCIe x16 slot (originally meant for a second GPU), and that opened up better solutions. I started browsing Amazon and came across a well-reviewed PCIe card that included both **WiFi 6E** and **Bluetooth 5.3** in a single unit. Even better: it was cheaper than buying two higher-end USB adapters.

I installed it in under 10 minutes, and the results were immediate:

- WiFi speeds **tripled**
- Bluetooth audio became **rock-solid**
- Two USB ports now free for other things

After testing a round of Fortnite myself (I managed to place 7th â€” my son was _not_ impressed), I could confidently say: the upgrade was a win.

## Why Desktops Still Matter

This whole experience reminded me why desktop computers remain a better long-term investment than laptops in many scenarios:

- **Upgradability:** From storage to GPUs to networking cards, you can change what you need, when you need it.
- **Performance per Dollar:** You usually get more power for less money compared to laptops.
- **Fixability:** If something breaks or underperforms, you can swap a part â€” not the whole machine.
- **Fewer Compromises:** Cooling, power, ports, screen choice â€” it's all in your control.

Laptops are great when you need portability. But for a home setup â€” especially one meant to last or grow â€” itâ€™s hard to beat a well-chosen desktop.

## A New Generation of Tinkerers?

I donâ€™t know if my son will ever get into PC building like I did, but this project gave us a small bonding moment â€” and gave me the chance to dust off some hardware knowledge I hadnâ€™t used in years. Whether heâ€™s editing his latest YouTube video or chasing a Victory Royale, I know the setup can handle it. And if it ever falls short?

Well, weâ€™ll just upgrade a part.

Thanks for reading! If youâ€™re on the fence about a new laptop vs a desktop, I hope this gave you something to think about. And if youâ€™re in the same boat â€” fixing up an old tower or helping your kid get started â€” Iâ€™d love to hear how itâ€™s going.

Happy building!
