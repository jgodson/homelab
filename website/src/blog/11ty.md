After getting my website up on my homelab, I wanted a clean, simple way to document my setup and share occasional insights. It needed to stay self-hosted, had to be lightweight and easy to use, and I didn't see a reason to have a backend running for a simple blog. This post is about how I ended up with [11ty (Eleventy)](https://www.11ty.dev) and the lessons I learned along the way.

## Starting With Just HTML

Initially, I had planned to continue to build everything manually using plain HTML and CSS. After realizing I needed a 404 page, I copyed the structure from my index file and tweaked the content. Then I started building out a blog list... pretty quickly, it became clear that even a minimal site was going to be painful to maintain by hand this way. Every new post would require copy-pasting HTML, updating lists manually, and managing links â€” things that quickly get tedious.

That's when I started searching for a lightweight and easily customizeable static site generator and stumbled across Eleventy.

## Enter Eleventy: Simple but Powerful

Eleventy immediately appealed to me because it's just JavaScript and templates â€” no massive framework to learn, no complex build processes, plus lots of plugins available. In fact, its simplicity is deceptive; underneath is a powerful system that gives me complete control.

The deciding factor was that I could:
- Write everything in Markdown
- Use simple templates for consistency
- Easily self-host since it's all static files (plus fast and secure)
- Check everything into Git

## The Implementation Journey

Getting the basic site running was surprisingly simple. I used Claude to quickly extract my HTML files into templates and get the Eleventy build set up. Though, as with any project, the interesting challenges emerged when I started refining things.

### Planning Ahead

I knew as my post count grew, I would need pagination. Implementing it was actually pretty straightforward with the templates.

I then also wanted to set up a tag system that will help me organize content, and allow readers find what they are interested in as it grows. I'm keeping the links to the tag browser hidden until I have enough posts to justify making it visible.

### The Hard Part

Like any website project, the real challenge was â€” you guessed it â€” the CSS. Getting the spacing and the look and feel just right required several rounds of adjustments:

- Balancing the space between all the elements, like posts and pagination controls
- Creating consistent spacing around the header and footer
- Ensuring that tags were subtly available on the blog list page, without pulling _too_ much attention to them
- Ensuring it was mobile-friendly

Making everything feel natural took more tweaking than I thought it would. Even though I was able to get most of the way there with AI, it still took several rounds of adjustments and manual tweaks. I'm quite happy with the end result though!

### The Date Time Zone Saga

Another odd issue was with dates. Posts kept displaying a day earlier than specified in the frontmatter. After digging in a bit, I discovered it was a timezone issue with how dates were being interpreted.

The solution wasn't super elegant â€” incrementing the date by one day in the template filters â€” but it worked and it looks like this:

```javascript
eleventyConfig.addFilter("dateToFormat", function(date) {
  if (!date) return '';
  
  const dateObj = new Date(date);
  
  // The timezone adjustment
  dateObj.setDate(dateObj.getDate() + 1);
  
  const options = { year: 'numeric', month: 'long', day: 'numeric' };
  return dateObj.toLocaleDateString('en-US', options);
});
```

Sometimes pragmatic solutions beat perfectly elegant ones when you just need something to work.

### Custom Asset Build for Versioning

One of the things I built for the original HTML site was a custom script to handle asset versioning using content-based hashes. This made sure users always got the latest styles and assets even with a longer `Cache-Control` policy.

If you're interested, the [build script is available on GitHub](https://github.com/jgodson/homelab/blob/main/website/build.js). One thing I wanted it to do was print out a tree view of the final directory structure and the file sizes after a successful build, which looks like this:

```bash
Build complete ðŸŽ‰
Location: /Users/jasongodson/Documents/github/homelab/website/dist

â”‚       â””â”€â”€ ... (font files listed)
â”œâ”€â”€ blog/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ... (posts organized by folder)
```

Itâ€™s a small thing, but it makes it easy to verify the output and keep things tidy. Plus, it's just cool.

## Was It Worth It?

Absolutely. The time spent setting up Eleventy has already paid dividends in how easily I can now document my explorations. A static site is lightweight and doesn't contribute noticeably to resource use, and adding new content is frictionless.

Now that I have a solid foundation, I'm looking forward to:

- Documenting my homelab infrastructure and how it all came together
- Sharing troubleshooting tips that might help others
- Creating tutorials based on my experiments
- Using this blog as a personal reference
